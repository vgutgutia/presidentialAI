# OceanGuard AI - Home Page & About Page Demo Script (2 Minutes)

## Setup
- Open browser to http://localhost:3000
- Start at the top of the home page
- Have the About page ready to navigate to

---

## HOME PAGE - Hero Section (20 seconds)

**"Welcome to OceanGuard AI. This is our landing page—a modern, responsive interface built with Next.js and React."**

*[Pause briefly to let animations load]*

**"At the top, you see our hero section with the tagline 'PROTECTING OUR OCEANS.' Notice the animated background particles and gradient effects that create a dynamic, ocean-inspired aesthetic. The navigation bar at the top provides quick access to Dashboard, Analyze, and About pages."**

**"The hero section emphasizes our core mission: AI-powered satellite imagery analysis that detects marine debris before it devastates coastlines. We offer real-time monitoring, precision detection, and global scale capabilities."**

---

## HOME PAGE - Scroll to Stats Section (15 seconds)

*[Scroll down slowly]*

**"As we scroll down, we reach the statistics section titled 'THE SCALE OF THE CRISIS.' These numbers tell a sobering story: 14 million tons of plastic enter our oceans yearly, over 500 dead zones have been identified globally, 80 percent of debris comes from land-based activity, and traditional methods miss 99 percent of debris."**

**"These animated counters highlight why our solution is necessary—the problem is massive, and current detection methods are insufficient."**

---

## HOME PAGE - Technology Section (20 seconds)

*[Continue scrolling]*

**"Next, we see our technology section: 'SEGFORMER AI MEETS SENTINEL-2.' This explains how we combine state-of-the-art transformer architecture with free, publicly available satellite imagery."**

**"The left side details our technical capabilities: 11 spectral bands from visible to SWIR wavelengths, 10-meter resolution that can detect objects as small as a car, and 5-day revisit cycles enabling continuous global monitoring."**

**"On the right, you see an animated visualization with orbiting rings representing our detection system in action. The floating labels show 'Debris Detected' and processing status, giving a sense of the real-time nature of our system."**

---

## HOME PAGE - CTA Section (10 seconds)

*[Scroll to bottom]*

**"At the bottom, we have a call-to-action section: 'READY TO DETECT?' This invites users to upload their satellite imagery and join the fight for cleaner oceans. The footer shows this is built for the Presidential AI Challenge 2026."**

---

## Navigate to About Page (5 seconds)

*[Click "ABOUT" in navigation or "LEARN MORE" button]*

**"Now let's navigate to the About page to learn more about our mission and technology."**

---

## ABOUT PAGE - Hero Section (10 seconds)

**"The About page opens with a similar design language—dark theme, animated backgrounds, and clear typography. The hero section introduces OceanGuard AI and explains that we're harnessing AI and satellite technology to protect oceans from marine debris."**

---

## ABOUT PAGE - Mission Section (15 seconds)

*[Scroll down]*

**"The Mission section explains the problem we're solving. Every year, over 14 million tons of plastic enter our oceans. Traditional monitoring methods—boats, planes, manual surveys—are expensive, slow, and cover only a fraction of the world's waters."**

**"The text explains how OceanGuard AI changes the game by combining free Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with deep learning to detect debris hotspots from space, providing early warning systems for environmental agencies worldwide."**

---

## ABOUT PAGE - Technology Section (20 seconds)

*[Continue scrolling]*

**"The Technology section breaks down our four key components. First, SegFormer Architecture—a state-of-the-art transformer-based semantic segmentation model adapted for 11-band multispectral satellite imagery."**

**"Second, Sentinel-2 Imagery—free, open-source satellite data from the European Space Agency with 10-meter resolution and global coverage every 5 days."**

**"Third, the MARIDA Dataset—we trained on the Marine Debris Archive, the largest labeled dataset of marine debris in satellite imagery."**

**"And fourth, Focal Loss Training—a custom loss function that handles extreme class imbalance, allowing detection of rare debris against vast ocean backgrounds."**

---

## ABOUT PAGE - System Architecture (10 seconds)

*[Scroll to architecture diagram]*

**"The System Architecture diagram shows our processing pipeline: Sentinel-2 satellite data flows through preprocessing with 11-band normalization, then SegFormer AI inference, post-processing for hotspot detection, and finally outputs in GeoTIFF and GeoJSON formats."**

---

## ABOUT PAGE - Performance & Closing (15 seconds)

*[Scroll to performance stats]*

**"The Performance section shows our model metrics: 85 percent plus IoU score, 0.89 F1 score, 256-pixel patch size, and under 2 seconds inference time per patch on GPU."**

**"At the bottom, we have a final call-to-action to launch detection, and information about our team and GitHub repository."**

---

## Closing Statement (10 seconds)

**"This interface demonstrates our commitment to both powerful technology and user experience. The design is modern, responsive, and clearly communicates our mission: using AI to protect our oceans at scale. Thank you."**
